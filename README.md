## What is it?

**Pulsar** is an automated network footprint scanner for Red Teams, Pentesters and Bounty Hunters.
Its focus is on discovery of organization public facing assets with minimal knowledge about its infrastructure. Along with network data visualization, it attempts to give a basic vulnerability score to find infrastructure weak points and their relation to other resources. It can be also used as a custom vulnerability scanner for wide and uncharted scopes.
This software was created with availability and openness in mind, so it is 100% free, and does not require any API keys to use its features.

> This is a beta release, be prepared to notice bugs or even crashes. Help me out and submitt an [issue](../../issues/new).
